Course & Bearing
==================

A [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) diagram for nautical Course and Bearing. Created when taking a Coastal Yachtmaster Diploma (sv: Kustskepparintyg, de: KÃ¼stenschifferschein).

The nomenclature and terms are my best effort, and may be somewhat erroneous.


Compile it with `pdflatex course_and_bearing.tex`. To use Swedish nomenclature, set `\newcommand{\useenglish}{false}` in the course_and_bearing.tex file.
